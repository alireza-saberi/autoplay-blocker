# Autoplay Blocker Chrome Extension

In this Chrome extension, we simply disable autoplay feature for the video tag. 
The Same technic can be applied when working with audio tag.

 - Get the video/audio tag
 - Move forward in length of element. 
 - Make the `autoplay` property of each frame `false`
